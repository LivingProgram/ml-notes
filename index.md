# Perceptron
* single unit that takes in a set of input nodes, multiplies those inputs by weights, and adds a bias node, returning an output of 1 or 0
* perceptron visualization: ![perceptron visualization](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_1.jpg)

## Perceptron Algorithm
* For all points \\((p,q) \text{ with label } y \\):
  * Calculate \\(\hat{y} = step(w_{1} * x_{1} + w_{2} * x_{2} + b)\\)
  * If the point is correctly classified: do nothing
  * If the point is classified positive, but it has a negative label: \\(w_{1} - \alpha * p\\), \\(w_{2} - \alpha * q\\), \\(b - \alpha\\)
  * If the point is classified negative, but it has a positive label: \\(w_{1} + \alpha * p\\), \\(w_{2} + \alpha * q\\), \\(b + \alpha\\)
  * (Where \\(\alpha = \\) learning rate)

# Error Function
* measures the model's performance
* must be continuous, not discrete, there should always be a direction towards a more optimal error 

## Sigmoid Activation Function
* sigmoid graph and equation: ![sigmoid function](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_2.jpg)
* takes in all real numbers and outputs a probability between 0 and 1 
* allows a continuous error function

# Softmax Function
* allows you to take linear set of scores for multiple classes and generate probabilities for each class that sum to 0
* exponent function used to avoid negative values (which can cause division by 0 if allowed)
* softmax equation: 
  * Linear output of scores for \\(n\\) classes: \\(Z_{1},Z_{2},\ldots,Z_{n}\\)
  * $$P(\text{class } i) = \frac{e^{Z_{i}}}{e^{Z_{1}}+e^{Z_{2}}+\ldots+e^{Z_{n}}}$$
* softmax with 2 classes: \\(n=2 \implies softmax(x)=sigmoid(x)\\)

# One-Hot Encoding
* with data that has multiple classes, assign a vector to each class (such that there is a 1 in the row that corresponds to the presence of the class, and the rest are all 0s)

# Maximum Likelihood
* method of picking the model that gives the existing labels the highest probability
* how likely a model's predictions are correct = product of the probabilities that every point is its labeled class
* maximizing the product of probabilities = best model

## Cross-Entropy Error Function
* Motivation for creating cross entropy function:
  * maximum likelihood is able to measure a model's performance
  * products = hard to compute and yield small numbers (instead use sums = easy to calculate)
  * use logs, because of the property \\(log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)\\) (allows our products to turn into sums)
  * log(number_between_0_and_1) = negative numbers (instead use -log() = positive)
  * if we use -log(), minimizing -log() = best model (because before, larger product = better model, and log(large_product) = small number, so now we need to minimize)
* Calculate predictions:

$$\hat{y}_{i}=\sigma(Wx_{i}+b)$$

* Cross Entropy (2 classes): 

$$E=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y_{i}ln(\hat{y}_{i})+(1-y_{i})ln(1-\hat{y}_{i})$$

* Cross Entropy (2 classes, with W = weights, b = bias): 

$$E(W,b)=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y_{i}ln(\sigma(Wx_{i}+b))+(1-y_{i})ln(1-\sigma(Wx_{i}+b))$$

* Cross Entropy (n classes): 

$$E=-\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}y_{ij}ln(\hat{y}_{ij})$$

* Explanations:
  * y = 1 or 0, therefore only one term in the summation is chosen, and that term will calculate the ln() of the correct probability, then sum the negative lnâ€™s
  * only take -ln() of probabilities that matter, formula when n = 2 turns out to be cross entropy formula for 2 classes

# Gradient Descent

## Gradient Descent Motivation: 
* we want to minimize the cross-entropy error to find the best model
* we need to find the lowest valley in the graph of error function and weights as that is where the error is least
* by taking negative partial derivative of error function with respect to each weight that is the direction to move in towards a lower error and a better model
* therefore we simply need to calculate the gradient of the error

## Gradient Descent Calculation
* Goal = Calculate the gradient of the error \\(= \Delta E\\)
* Given m points labeled: 

$$x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{m}$$

![m points](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_8.jpg)
* Predictions are calculated by the model using: 

$$\hat{y}_{i}=\sigma(Wx_{i}+b)$$

![prediction formula](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_9.jpg)
* The error for an individual point is: 

$$E=-yln(\hat{y})-(1-y)ln(1-\hat{y})$$

![individual point error formula](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_10.jpg)
* The overall error is simply the average of individual point errors: 

$$E=-\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y_{i}ln(\hat{y}_{i})+(1-y_{i})ln(1-\hat{y}_{i})$$

![overall error formula](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_11.jpg)
* The gradient of the error = partial derivatives of error for each weight: 

$$\Delta E = (\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{1}}E,\ldots,\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{n}}E,\frac{\partial}{\partial b}E)$$

![gradient of error formula](https://livingprogram.github.io/ml-notes/images/ml-notes_18.jpg)
* Significance: 
  * gradient = scalar x coordinates of point (scalar = label - prediction)
  * implies: label close to the prediction = small gradient

# Logistic Regression Algorithm
1. Initialize random weights: 
2. For every point:
   * Update weights:
   * Update bias:
3. Repeat until error is small
