# Format Guide

## In General
- Every new concept gets a `#`, sub-concepts add more `#`
- For concepts that cannot be put in text, camscan an image and upload to repo
- Bullet point concepts

## Equations Sections
- Equations section in bullets, explanations above equations

## Proofs Sections
- Proofs follow statements
- Proofs start with `(necessary number of #) Proof.`
- All text must be centered, put text in `$$\text{}$$`
- Every new block add `\\\\`
- Equations can be aligned (`$$\begin{align}\end{align}$$`) or centered (`$$$$`), depending on what looks better
- End of proof must have `\ \ \ \ \blacksquare\\\\`

## Applications Sections
- Each problem gets a bullet and number `1.)`
- Solution for problem is sub-bulleted (equations get their own bullet)
- Solution must end with bullet `Answer:` and the corresponding answer
- Example:

```md
- 1.) Problem 1
  - Solution step 1
  - Solution step 2
  - Equation for step 2
  - Solution step 3
  - Answer: corresponding answer
- 2.) Problem 2
  - Answer: corresponding answer
```
